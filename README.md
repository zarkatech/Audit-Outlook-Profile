# Audit-Outlook-Profile
PowerShell script which leverages COM to audit mailboxes, calendars, and other MAPI stores connected to an Outlook Profile.

Script was developed as a proof-of-concept and does indeed work, however it must be run on the local machine where Outlook is installed and did not prove effective for bulk migration scenarios.
